<h2>Lesson 1: <span class="title">Hello, World!</span></h2>
<p class="indent">
  It's time to dive in and look at some actual <a class="wikiterm">C</a> <a class="wikiterm">source code</a>.
  I present to you the classic <a class="wikiterm">Hello World</a> program:
</p>
{% highlight c linenos=inline %}
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n"); 
    return 0;
  }
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  With your new, amazing <a class="wikiterm">text editor</a> of choice, type the above and save the file as 
  <span class="file">hello.c</span>. I have purposefully left the line numbers in the code to make it more difficult 
  for you to copy and paste the examples. Hee. I have always found that typing out examples myself helps me remember them
  better. Besides, typing code is kind of like playing piano: the more you practice, the better you get. Consider this
  an exercise to bring you and your <a class="wikiterm">text editor</a> closer together.
</p>
<h3>So, What is This?</h3>
<p class="indent">
  Quite simply, this is a <a class="wikiterm">program</a>. For the moment, don't worry about exactly <a href="#how_it_works">how it works</a>. It is a file on your computer that contains only text. 
  Specifically, it is a <a class="wikiterm">C</a> program. It is a series of lines of <a href="" class="wikipedia">source code</a> 
  that act as input to the <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a>. The <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a> then transforms the 
  <a class="wikiterm">source code</a> into <a class="wikiterm">machine code</a>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Why? It may not seem like it, but computers are extremely simple. They cannot understand <a class="wikiterm">source code</a> 
  directly. It is too high-level. Expecting a computer to directly execute <a class="wikiterm">source code</a> is like trying to train your dog to drive a car
  by calmly sitting him down and explaining how to do it. It just isn't going to work. Your dog only understands a small 
  set of extremely simple <a class="wikiterm">instructions</a>. Sit. Stay. Fetch. Drive. (Lol, I'm just kidding about that 
  last one. Can you imagine? A driving dog!) But <em>you</em> can understand this high-level language. At least you will be able to if you
  continue to read these posts. It is the compiler's one and only task to translate this high-level, human-readable language
  into something your computer can understand: a long series of very simple, <a class="wikiterm">binary code</a> 
  <a class="wikiterm">instructions</a>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Now that you understand what <a class="wikiterm">source code</a> is a little better, you can imagine programming in
  <a class="wikiterm">C</a> as <span class="def">telling the compiler what to translate so your computer does what you 
  want</span>.
</p>
<h3>Let's Try It!</h3>
<p class="indent">
  Fire up your console (terminal), and navigate to the directory (folder) in which you saved your <span class="term">hello.c</span> file.
  (Type <span class="cmd">cd /path/to/file</span>. For example, if you're on Mac OS X and you saved the file to your Desktop, type <span class="cmd">cd /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Desktop</span>.)
  Once you're there, type <span class="cmd">gcc hello.c</span>. If it worked, you won't see any output in your console! Awesome! (If you see 
  anything, it means you probably typed something incorrectly, or the file is not actually where you think it is on your computer.)
</p>
<p class="indent">
  So what happened? The <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a> took your <span class="file">hello.c</span> file and turned it into
  an <a href="" class="wikiterm" data-url="executable">executable file</a> named <span class="term">a.out</span>. This is something
  your computer can understand. Let's run it! Type <span class="cmd">./a.out</span> in your console. You should see a single line of
  output:
</p>
{% highlight console %}
Hello, World!
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  Then your console should be ready for the next command. <em>Cool</em>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Before we get into how this <a class="wikiterm">program</a> works, let's note that <span class="term">a.out</span> is a pretty terrible name for an
  <a class="wikiterm">executable</a>. Let's <span class="term">recompile</span> the program to give us a differently-named
  file. Type <span class="cmd">gcc -o hello hello.c</span>. This command tells the compiler to create an <a class="wikiterm">executable</a>
  named <span class="term">hello</span>. Run it by typing <span class="cmd">./hello</span>. You should see the exact same result as
  when you ran <span class="cmd">./a.out</span>. <em>Rad</em>.
</p>
<h3><a name="how_it_works">How Does It Work?</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
  Let's not start at the beginning. Instead, we'll start at the middle. If you haven't guessed by now, line 3 is where the
  real action is:
</p>
{% highlight c %}
  printf("Hello, World!\n"); 
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  <span class="c">printf</span> is an example of a <span class="term">function call</span>. For now, don't worry about
  what that means, but keep the term in the back of your head. In the above, we are <span class="term">passing</span> it a
  single <span class="term">argument</span>, the <span class="term">string</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello, World!<span class="se">\n</span>&quot;</span>. These terms
  are all important, but let's focus on just one for now: a <span class="term">string</span>
  is a sequence of characters. That's pretty much it. In this example, our <span class="term">string</span> is a <span class="term">literal</span>,
  meaning it is written directly into the <a class="wikiterm">source code</a>. We'll talk about non-literal <span class="term">strings</span> in the coming lessons.
  The <span class="c">printf</span> function takes this <span class="term">string</span>, and then prints it out. You do not 
  need to worry about exactly how it works (for now).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  But what is that weird &quot;<span class="se">\n</span>&quot;, you ask? Excellent question, my highly intelligent and beautiful 
  imaginary pupil! &quot;<span class="se">\n</span>&quot; is a <span class="term">special character</span>. The &quot;<span class="se">\</span>&quot;
  in front of the &quot;<span class="se">n</span>&quot; tells the <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a> to interpret the &quot;<span class="se">\</span>&quot;
  plus the character immediately after as a <em>single</em> character. Specifically, &quot;<span class="se">\n</span>&quot;
  is the <span class="term">newline character</span>. When your computer sees this character, rather than printing something visible, it
  starts a new line. In our example, this has the courteous effect of returning us to the command prompt. Try
  removing the &quot;<span class="se">\n</span>&quot;, then <span class="term">recompile</span> with <span class="cmd">gcc -o hello hello.c</span> and execute <span class="cmd">./hello</span>.
  Just look at what chaos and havoc you have wrought.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Last but not least, there is a semicolon after the call to <span class="c">printf</span>. In <a class="wikiterm">C</a>,
  all <span class="term">statements</span> end with a semicolon. Get used to knowing <em>exactly</em> where to find it on your keyboard. 
  It's how the <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a> knows the <span class="term">statement</span> is complete. 
  With more practice, the distinction between what is a <span class="term">statement</span> and what is not will become more clear.
</p>
<h3>Line 1</h3>
{% highlight c %}
  #include <stdio.h>
{% endhighlight %}
<p class="indent">
  Now you know a little bit about how the <span class="c">printf</span> <span class="term">function</span> works. As you 
  can probably imagine, this will be quite useful in the coming years of your life as a 1337 h4x0r. But let's take a 
  look at all of that other stuff in the code. After all, there are 5 lines, not just 1. We didn't type it all
  because it was fun. In line 1, <span class="cp">#include</span> is a <span class="term">compiler directive</span>.
  This tells the <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a> to do something <em>before</em> it begins compiling the the
  rest of the code. This part of the compilation process is often called the <a class="wikiterm">preprocessor</a>. 
  Line 1 of our program tells the <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a> to use the specified file name, <span class="cp">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>,
  and to continue compilation as if the entire contents of that file were directly copied and
  pasted into the original <a class="wikiterm">source code</a>. The file <span class="file">stdio.h</span> also contains 
  <a class="wikiterm">source code</a>: it is primarily a long list of <span class="term">function declarations</span>, 
  one of which is our good friend, <span class="c">printf</span>. We'll talk more about <span class="term">function declarations</span> 
  in the coming lessons, but for now, just know that if you write <span class="c">printf</span> somewhere in your code without 
  <span class="cp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>, the <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a> isn't sure what the hell you're talking about.
</p>
<p class="indent">
   In fact, let's try it: remove line 1 from <span class="file">hello.c</span>, and recompile. You should see something like the
   following:
</p>
{% highlight console %}
hello.c: In function ‘main’:
hello.c:2: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘printf’
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  This is a <span class="term">compiler warning</span>. The <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a> still made you an
  <a class="wikiterm">executable file</a>, but it's trying to tell you that there's something you should
  really look into. In this particular case, it's telling you that you're trying to use <span class="c">printf</span>
  without <span class="term">declaring</span> it first (more on this in the coming lessons). Let's go back and re-add the line you just took out, and recompile.
  Now everything is peachy. In fact, let's go one step further. Recompile with this command: <span class="cmd">gcc -Wall -o hello hello.c</span>.
  You should see no output. This tells you that everything is <em>super peachy</em>, as the <span class="cmd">-Wall</span>
  flag tells <a class="wikiterm">gcc</a> to give you every possible warning in your code. From now on, we will always compile using the <span class="cmd">-Wall</span> flag
  and your goal will be to produce code that gives you absolutely no warnings. 
</p>
<h3>Line 2</h3>
{% highlight c %}
  int main() {
{% endhighlight %}
<p class="indent">
  In technical terms, this is a <span class="term">function definition</span> for the <span class="nf">main</span> function.
  For now, all you need to know is that this is the entry-point into our program. This tells your <a class="wikiterm">operating system</a> where to start
  when you run your program. All of your <a class="wikiterm">C</a> programs will have a <span class="term">function definition</span> for <span class="nf">main</span>.
  With the following we're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves, but this <span class="term">function definition</span> tells us that <span class="nf">main</span>
  takes no <span class="term">arguments</span> and <span class="term">returns</span> an <span class="kt">int</span>.
</p>
<h3>Line 3</h3>
<p class="indent">
  We've seen it, unless you're not paying attention.
</p>
<h3>Line 4</h3>
{% highlight c %}
  return 0;
{% endhighlight %}
<p class="indent">
  This is a <span class="term">return statement</span>. Again, more on this in the coming lessons, but in the context of
  whatever <span class="term">function</span> you're defining, this specifies what output value the <span class="term">function</span> will produce, if any. Here,
  we're <span class="term">returning</span> an output value to the <a class="wikiterm">operating system</a>. Specifically, a <span class="term">return value</span>
  of <span class="mi">0</span> from <span class="nf">main</span> tells the <a class="wikiterm">operating system</a>, 
  "Everything went well. We're all done here."
</p>
<h3>Line 5</h3>
{% highlight c %}
  }
{% endhighlight %}
<p class="indent">
  This closes the <span class="term">function definition</span> of <span class="nf">main</span>. Without it, our
  program would contain a <span class="term">syntax error</span>. Basically, this means that there is a problem
  with our <a class="wikiterm">source code</a> that prevents the <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a> from correctly reading it. If your code contains a
  <span class="term">syntax error</span>, the <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a> will not give you an <a class="wikiterm">executable file</a>.
  Let's try it and see what happens. But first, let's get rid of your current <span class="file">hello</span> executable. Type
  <span class="cmd">rm hello</span>. Just to make sure it's gone, use the <span class="cmd">ls</span> command if you're
  comfortable with that (you're going to have to learn these UNIX commands at some point), or simply try to execute
  <span class="cmd">./hello</span>. You should see something like &quot;No such file or directory&quot;.
  Now, edit your <span class="file">hello.c</span> file, and remove line 5. Recompile (<span class="cmd">gcc -Wall -o hello hello.c</span>),
  and you should see this:
</p>
{% highlight console %}
hello.c: In function ‘main’:
hello.c:4: error: expected declaration or statement at end of input
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  This is a <span class="term">compiler error</span>. As you might have guessed, these can be fairly cryptic. Learning to
  understand these will eventually become second-nature. For now, this one is basically the <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a>
  saying, &quot;Aww turds. I got all the way to the end of the input, and something isn't right. Bail.&quot; Now type <span class="cmd">ls hello</span>.
</p>
{% highlight console %}
ls: hello: No such file or directory
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  Whoops. There's no <a class="wikiterm">executable file</a>. This means we <em>really</em> have to fix the <a class="wikiterm">source code</a>.
  Go back, replace the &quot;<span class="p">}</span>&quot;, and recompile. Once again, everything is right with the world, and typing
  <span class="cmd">ls hello</span> in our console shows us this:
</p>
{% highlight console %}
hello
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  This means we once again have an <a class="wikiterm">executable file</a>. Yay!
</p>
<h3>Until Next Time</h3>
<p class="indent">
  That's all for now! Until the next lesson, try playing around with <span class="file">hello.c</span>. Add some <span class="term">newline characters</span>
  to the <span class="term">string</span> passed to <span class="c">printf</span>. Add more calls to <span class="c">printf</span>. Remove the
  semicolon after the call to <span class="c">printf</span> to see what happens when you forget one. 
  Remove the <span class="term">return statement</span>. Try all sorts of crazy crap. Next time, we're actually going
  to do something cool, so get some practice time in with your <a class="wikiterm">text editor</a> and <a class="wikiterm">gcc</a>!
