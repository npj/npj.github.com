  Welcome to <span class="term">C is for Code</span>. Here, you are going to learn to program: to tell a computer 
  what to do, in no uncertain terms. You are going to do this because <a class="wikiterm">programming</a> is <span class="term">awesome</span>. 
  Specifically, you are going to learn to write <a class="wikiterm">source code</a> in the <a class="wikiterm">C</a> 
  <a class="wikiterm">programming language</a>. 
  But programming is also difficult, and <a class="wikiterm">C</a> notoriously so for beginners. 
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Then why <a class="wikiterm">C</a>? In a word, it is <span class="term">important</span>. 
  <a class="wikiterm">C</a> is the foundation of countless pieces of software. It is <span class="term">everywhere</span>.
  Your computer's operating system was written in <a class="wikiterm">C</a>. The web browser with which you are viewing
  this page was written in <a class="wikiterm">C</a>, or one of its many variants.
  It is even the foundation of many other programming languages. Learning <a class="wikiterm">C</a> is like 
  learning how to drive manual transmission. You need to do a lot of extra work, but you will have complete control. And once 
  you learn, you never forget.

<h3>This Project</h3>
<p class="indent">
  It is hard for us who have been doing this for years and years to remember what it was like in the beginning. If you have
  ever attended an introductory course by an obligated grad student, you have probably experienced a great deal of
  confusion. That is why I started this project. My goal is to help absolute beginners learn how to program from the ground-up,
  from someone who is both passionate about programming <span class="term">and</span> teaching. I want to present you
  with clear explanations, and to guide you through the learning process slowly and steadily. And, should anything be
  remotely unclear, I encourage you to <a href="mailto:peter.brindisi+cc@gmail.com">contact me</a>. My hope is that when you 
  reach the end, you will be well on your way to becoming a master programmer.
</p>

<h3>Needed Materials</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      A <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a>. A large part of <a class="wikiterm">C</a> programming is getting familiar with the <a class="wikiterm">compiler</a>. 
      All of the examples will assume you are using <a class="wikiterm">GCC</a> <span class="term">version 4 or greater.</span>
      Unfortunately, if your operating system is Windows, this may be the most challenging part of getting set-up. I recommend you
      take a look at <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>. 
      If you are using a Linux-based operating system (like Ubuntu) or UNIX-based (like Mac OS X), you may already have <a class="wikiterm">GCC</a> installed.
      If you are using Mac OS X, you can freely download and install the latest version of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/index.php" target="_blank">XCode</a>.
      Be warned that this will take a while. Once you have finished, open the <span class="term">Terminal</span> application (<span class="term">Applications</span> &gt; <span class="term">Utilites</span> &gt; <span class="term">Terminal</span>)
      and type <span class="cmd">gcc -v</span>. Ubuntu (or other Debian) users need only to install the <span class="term">gcc</span> package.
      In the console, type <span class="cmd">sudo apt-get install gcc</span>. Once finished, to verify the installation, type <span class="cmd">gcc -v</span>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A <a class="wikiterm">text editor</a>. For Mac OS X users, I highly recommend <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/" target="_blank">MacVim</a> or <a href="http://macromates.com/" target="_blank">TextMate</a>.
      Linux users may choose between <a class="wikiterm">vim</a> or <a class="wikiterm">emacs</a>, and thus begin a lifetime of <a href="" class="wikiterm" data-url="editor_war">misdirected aggression</a> 
      towards whomever chose the other.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <span class="term">Patience</span>. Of all the things you will need to get started programming, this is perhaps the most
      important. You will experience times when you want to put your fist through a wall because something &quot;just doesn't work.&quot;
      Even many seasoned professionals, myself included, often describe the feeling of &quot;hammering away&quot; at some difficult code,
      only to realize how simple the solution was 5 minutes after breaking down and stepping back from the problem. Having a great deal
      of patience will get you farther than you can understand right now.
